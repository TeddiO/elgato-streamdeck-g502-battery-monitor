# G502 Battery Stream Deck Monitor

A plugin for the Stream Deck that allows for monitoring the battery level of a Logitech G502 Lightspeed mouse (and variants).

Upon boot or back to the page with the indicator on, it'll query the battery level and update the charge accoringly. It'll also give you an indicator for when it's charging and / or fully charged, as well as the warning icon for when the battery level drops below 20%.

- WIP, needs some custom iconography / backrounds.
- Requires the Logitech G-Hub to be installed.
- Based on the beta NodeJS SDK for the Stream Deck (https://github.com/elgatosf/streamdeck)
- Requires Stream Deck 6.4 or newer.
