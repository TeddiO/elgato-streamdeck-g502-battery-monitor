# G502 Battery Stream Deck Monitor

A plugin for the Stream Deck that allows for monitoring the battery level of a Logitech G502 Lightspeed mouse (and variants).

This project is currently a work in progress and needs some tidying, but does otherwise work.

- Requires the Logitech G-Hub to be installed.
- Based on the beta NodeJS SDK for the Stream Deck (https://github.com/elgatosf/streamdeck)
- Requires Stream Deck 6.4 or newer.
